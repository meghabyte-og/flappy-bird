This is a PC version of the popular game Flappy Bird, developed using Unity. Instead of tapping the screen, the player controls the bird's flight by pressing the space bar on the keyboard. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through a series of gaps between pipes without colliding with them.

# Features
* Simple gameplay.
* Realistic physics simulation for the bird's flight, collision detection using circular colliders, box colliders and triggers.
* Obstacle spawning and destruction for optimized memory usage.
* Score counter that increments with each successful obstacle passed.
* Smooth and responsive controls using the space bar.
* Game over screen with the option to restart the game.

# Usage
### Game File: gameplay -> FlappyBird.exe
* Press the space bar to make the bird flap and gain altitude.
* Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
* Each successfully passed obstacle increases the score.
* Colliding with the pipes or the ground ends the game.
* After the game ends, click the "Play Again" bar to restart.

# Development
This game was developed using Unity, a popular game development engine. The following components were used:
* **Unity Physics**: Used to simulate the bird's flight and handle collision detection.
* **C# Scripting**: Implemented various game mechanics, such as obstacle spawning, score counting, and game over logic.
* **Unity UI**: Created user interface elements, scenes, including the score counter and game over screen.
* **Prefabs**: Utilized prefabs for obstacle pipes and the bird character for easy instantiation and customization.
